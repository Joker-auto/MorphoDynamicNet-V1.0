# MorphoDynamicNet
There are two folders and two file under the code directory:

MorphoDynamicNet.py
The MorphoDynamicNet.py file contains the core code .

yaml
The yaml folder contains the YAML files required for YOLOv8 training. 

nn
The nn folder contains all the code required for the experiment. You can integrate this by replacing the nn folder in your ultralytics directory with the one in the provided code.

Alternatively, you can integrate the MorphoDynamicNet mechanism into your YOLOv8 model by following similar approaches used in other attention mechanism integrations.

Comparison
The content of the Comparison.xlsx file includes all the experimental results and comparisons we conducted.
